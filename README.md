# Raspberry Pi OS with pi-top support

*The latest Raspberry Pi OS release with the latest pi-top drivers already included*

A minimal [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) distribution for pi-tops. It includes [pi-topd](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-topd) and its dependencies (incl. the [pi-top Python SDK](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-Python-SDK)).

This repository contains the source script to generate the distribution out of an existing [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) distro image.
